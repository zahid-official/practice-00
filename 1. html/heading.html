    <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is Heading 6</h6>

    <p><b>Note:</b> that the h1 tag is only used once, as the main heading of the page. h2 to h6, however, can be used as often as desired, but they should always be used in order, as they were intended. <br> For example, an h4 should be a sub-heading of an h3, which should be a sub-heading of an h2.  Do not use h4 and then h2. Generally, tags up to h3 are used in continuous text, rarely up to h4.</p>
